    "# State\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates the state-dependent behavior into separate classes, called state classes, and delegates the behavior to the current state object. This pattern promotes the principle of encapsulation and simplifies the management of complex state-dependent logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The State pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulates State-specific Behavior: The State pattern encapsulates the behavior associated with each state into separate state classes. Each state class focuses on a specific behavior, making it easier to understand, modify, and test individual states independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplifies State Transitions: The pattern simplifies the management of state transitions. The context object delegates the state-dependent behavior to the current state object, eliminating the need for conditional statements to determine the behavior based on the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports Open/Closed Principle: The State pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle by making it easier to add new states without modifying the existing code. New state classes can be added by implementing the State interface or subclassing the existing concrete state classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves Maintainability: The pattern improves the maintainability of code by separating the state-specific behavior from the context. It enhances code readability, reduces duplication, and makes it easier to locate and modify state-related logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports Dynamic Behavior Changes: The State pattern allows the dynamic switching of states during runtime. The context object can change its state by replacing the current state object with another state object, enabling the object's behavior to adapt to different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhances Testability: The State pattern promotes better testability as the behavior associated with each state can be tested independently. Unit tests can be written specifically for each state class to ensure that the behavior is correct for that particular state.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The State pattern is commonly used in scenarios where an object's behavior depends on its internal state, and this behavior changes dynamically. It promotes a clean separation of concerns, simplifies the management of state-dependent logic, and improves code maintainability and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- Context: It represents the object that contains the state and whose behavior varies based on the state. The context maintains a reference to the current state object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- State: It defines the interface or base class for all the concrete state classes. It declares methods that encapsulate the state-dependent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concrete State: It represents the specific states of the context and provides the implementation for the state-specific behavior. Each concrete state class implements the methods declared in the State interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client: It interacts with the context object and can initiate state transitions."
