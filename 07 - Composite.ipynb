    "# Composite\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It treats individual objects (`Leaf`) and groups of objects (`Composite`) uniformly, enabling clients to interact with them in a consistent manner. The Composite pattern enables the construction of complex structures while providing a simple interface to manipulate and traverse the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The Composite pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniformity: The Composite pattern provides a uniform interface to both leaf and composite objects. This allows clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects in the same way, simplifying the code and making it more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: The Composite pattern allows you to create complex structures by nesting objects within objects, forming a recursive tree-like structure. It enables you to represent part-whole hierarchies with varying levels of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplified Client Code: With the Composite pattern, client code can interact with the entire hierarchy as a single object. The client doesn't need to be aware of the internal structure of the hierarchy or distinguish between leaf and composite objects. This simplifies the client code and reduces its dependency on the specific implementation of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Structure Modification: The Composite pattern allows for dynamic modification of the structure at runtime. Components can be added, removed, or rearranged within the hierarchy without affecting the client code. This provides flexibility in managing and manipulating the structure as the requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Both leaf and composite objects can be reused in different compositions. This promotes code reusability and modularity by allowing components to be shared and combined in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursive Operations: The Composite pattern enables operations to be recursively applied to the entire hierarchy. Operations defined in the Component class can be implemented in the composite object to perform the operation on itself and then recursively invoke the operation on its child components.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Composite pattern is commonly used in scenarios where you need to represent part-whole hierarchies or structures, such as representing graphical user interfaces, file systems, organization hierarchies, or nested data structures. It provides a flexible and intuitive way to work with complex structures, simplifying the client code and promoting code reusability and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- The Component class defines the common interface for both the leaf objects (`Leaf`) and composite objects (`Composite`). It declares operations that are applicable to both types of objects, such as adding, removing, or accessing children components, and performing operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Leaf class represents the leaf objects, which are the indivisible building blocks of the hierarchy. They implement the operations defined by the Component class, but these operations are not applicable to them as they do not have any children.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Composite class represents the composite objects, which are the containers that can hold other components. They implement the operations defined by the Component class and also maintain a collection of child components. These operations are typically delegated to the child components."

    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Component class is the abstract base class for both the leaf (`Leaf`) and composite (`Composite`) components. It defines common operations such as `Add()`, `Remove()`, and `Display()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Leaf` class represents the leaf component that cannot have children. It implements the `Add()`, `Remove()`, and `Display()` methods, but they are not applicable to a leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Composite` class represents the composite component that can have children. It maintains a list of child components and implements the `Add()`, `Remove()`, and `Display()` methods accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Client` class demonstrates how the Composite pattern is used. It creates a root composite and several leaf and composite components, adds them to the structure, and displays the entire structure using the `Display()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> By utilizing the Composite pattern, you can create a tree-like structure of objects where individual objects (`Leaf`) and groups of objects (`Composite`) are treated uniformly. The composite can be composed of one or more components, forming a recursive structure. The client code can interact with the structure as a whole, regardless of whether it's a single leaf or a composite of multiple components. This pattern simplifies the client code and provides a flexible way to represent part-whole hierarchies."
