    "# Design Patterns in Software Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Design patterns in software architecture or \"Architectural patterns\" (in software context) are high-level, reusable solutions to common design problems that help structure and organize software systems. These patterns provide guidelines and best practices for designing the overall structure of an application, ensuring modularity, scalability, maintainability, and other desirable qualities. They also help architects and developers communicate and document design decisions using a common vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope. While software design patterns are concerned with the internal design of a single software component, architectural patterns address the overall structure of the software system. They are larger in scope and capture the fundamental organization of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of pattern depends on factors such as the nature of the systems being developed and integrated, communication requirements, performance considerations; and format, volume and complexity of the data. Multiple patterns can be combined to achieve more complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Architectural patterns are like blueprints that can be used to guide the design and implementation of a software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "There is no widely accepted official classification of \"Architectural Patterns Categories\" as opposed to the well-defined one for design patterns in software development. So, for the mere necessity of organizing them to be able to explain them better, I will use a mix between real categories (like *integration patterns*) and made-up ones (like *structural patterns*).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I will classify them in the following categories:\n",
    "- Structural Patterns: For the patterns that deals with the overall structure of the application.\n",
    "- Integration Patterns: For the patterns that deals with how the parts of the structure can communicate, exchange data, and work together effectively.\n",
    "- Data Management Patterns: For the patterns that deals with how data is stored, accessed, retrieved and manipulated.\n",
    "- Other Patterns: For the patterns that don't fit in the previous categories (and will not be covered).\n",
    "\n",
    "> You could classify them in other ways (General Patterns vs Specific Patterns, etc...), but I think this is the most useful way to do it. So, let's start with the structural patterns.\n"

    "## Structural Patterns\n",
    "I will categorize here the patterns that deals with the overall structure of the application and provide a way to organize code and components into a complete system. They help ensure that the system is flexible, extensible, and maintainable over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of structural patterns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Server Architecture\n",
    "In a [Client-Server Architecture](<Software Architecture/02 - Client-Server Architecture.ipynb>) the system is divided into a client and a server, with the client making requests to the server and the server responding to those requests. The client and server can be on the same machine or on different machines connected over a network (e.g. utilizing HTTP protocol). The client can be a web browser, a desktop application, a mobile app, or any other type of application that communicates with the server and have the ability to present a graphical user interface (GUI). The server can be a web server, an application server, a database server, or any other type of server that responds to client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Both the server and the GUI for the client should have their own well-defined structural patterns as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layered Architecture\n",
    "In a [Layered Architecture](<Software Architecture/03 - Layered Architecture.ipynb>), the system is divided into logical layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility and interacting with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces. The most common layers are the presentation layer (user interface or GUI), business logic layer (application logic), and data access layer (data persistence).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The server and GUI could also have it's own inner architecture (e.g. component-based architecture for the GUI and microservices architecture for the server, both composing parts of a layered architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component-based Architecture\n",
    "Component-based architecture is a software development methodology that focuses on building systems by decomposing them into reusable and independent components. These components are self-contained, modular units that encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily combined to create complex applications. In this architecture the system is composed of interconnected components, where each component provides a well-defined set of services or functionality. It's common to utilize this architecture in the GUI of the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-View-Controller (MVC)\n",
    "This pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input and coordinates interactions between the model and view). It promotes separation of concerns and facilitates modular development. It's common to utilize this architecture in the GUI of the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)\n",
    "Similar to MVC, MVVM separates an application into three components: the model (data and business logic), the view (user interface), and the view model (intermediary between the model and view, exposing data and operations). It's a slightly more polished version of the today-unused Model-View-Presenter (MVP)\" pattern. It's common to utilize this architecture in the GUI of the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\n",
    "This pattern structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate with each other through standard interfaces (e.g., web services). Services are autonomous, maintain their state, and provide well-defined operations that other services can use. It's common to utilize this architecture in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monolithic Architecture\n",
    "A monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where the entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In a monolithic system, all components, modules, and functionalities are tightly integrated and run as a single process. The monolith typically consists of using a Layered Architecture but operates as a single unit. This approach is simple and easy to develop and test but can be difficult to scale and maintain. You can have a *Monolith* architecture in the client, in the server or in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microservices\n",
    "In a microservices architecture, the system is divided into a set of small, independent (loosely coupled) services that communicate with each other over a network (through lightweight protocols like HTTP or messaging queues). Each service focuses on a specific business capability, is self-contained and can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently. It is a specialization of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style and unlike Monolithic Architecture, it is a distributed architecture. It's common to utilize this architecture in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These are some of the most common structural patterns, but there are many others like: Pipes and Filters, Blackboards, Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters), etc... that we will not cover here. Now, let's move on to the integration patterns."

    "## Integration Patterns\n",
    "Integration patterns in software development refer to established solutions for connecting and integrating disparate systems, applications, or components. These patterns provide guidance on how different systems can communicate, exchange data, and work together effectively. When you decide the structural pattern for your software, then you will need to decide integration patterns for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of commonly used integration patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Queue\n",
    "This pattern involves using a message queue to enable asynchronous communication between systems. Messages are placed on a queue by the sender and consumed by the receiver(s) at their own pace. It decouples systems, provides reliability, and handles high-volume scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publish-Subscribe\n",
    "Also known as the *pub-sub pattern* it can be described as an observer pattern at the architectural level. This pattern facilitates the broadcasting of messages from a single sender to multiple interested receivers. The sender (publisher) publishes messages to specific topics, and the receivers (subscribers) subscribe to the topics they are interested in. It allows for loosely coupled communication and event-driven architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request-Reply\n",
    "In this pattern, one system (requester) sends a request message to another system (responder) and expects a response. The request contains the necessary information for the responder to process and generate a response. It is commonly used in synchronous communication scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remote Procedure Invocation (RPI)\n",
    "RPI pattern enables a system to invoke procedures or methods on a remote system as if they were local. It encapsulates the complexity of network communication and remote service invocation, providing a simple and familiar programming model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point-to-Point\n",
    "This pattern involves direct communication between two systems, where one system initiates the interaction and sends messages directly to the target system. It is a simple and direct way of integrating two systems but can become complex when integrating multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)\n",
    "In an event-driven architecture, the system is built around the idea of events, which are generated when something happens (e.g. a user clicks a button, a sensor detects a change in temperature, etc.). This pattern emphasizes the production, detection, consumption, and reaction to events within a system. Components communicate by publishing and subscribing to events, enabling loose coupling, scalability, and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)\n",
    "DDD focuses on designing software systems based on a deep understanding of the business domain. It emphasizes the development of a rich domain model, encapsulating the business logic and behavior. DDD also introduces concepts like aggregates, repositories, and bounded contexts to manage complexity and maintain a clear separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Processing\n",
    "Batch processing patterns are used when large volumes of data need to be processed in scheduled or batched jobs. It involves collecting and processing data in batches rather than in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These are some of the most common integration patterns, but there are many others like: Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Adapter, etc... that we will not cover here. Now, let's move on to the data management patterns."
   ]
  },
  {
   "attachments": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Data Management Patterns\n",
    "Data management patterns in software development are approaches or patterns that help structure and organize how data is stored, accessed, retrieved and manipulated within an application or system. These patterns provide guidelines for managing data effectively and ensuring data consistency, maintainability, integrity, scalability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of commonly used data management patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Access Object (DAO)\n",
    "The DAO pattern provides a way to abstract the data persistence logic and encapsulate CRUD operations for a specific data entity. DAOs provide methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from the underlying storage (typically a database). They isolate the application from the details of the data source and provide a consistent interface for data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repository Pattern\n",
    "The Repository pattern provides a higher-level abstraction for data access. It acts as a collection of objects, providing methods for querying and manipulating data entities. Repositories typically encapsulate complex querying logic and handle the mapping between the application's domain objects and the underlying data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit of Work Pattern\n",
    "The unit of work pattern provides a way to manage transactions and ensure data consistency during a series of related database operations. It groups multiple database operations into a single transaction and ensures that either all operations succeed or none of them are applied. The unit of work pattern helps maintain data integrity and rollback changes if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Object\n",
    "The Query Object pattern encapsulates complex query logic into reusable objects. Instead of writing raw *SQL* queries, the Query Object pattern allows developers to construct queries using a fluent interface or *DSL (Domain-Specific Language)*. It promotes query reuse, improves readability, and helps prevent *SQL injection attacks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)\n",
    "ORM is a pattern that facilitate the mapping of database tables to object-oriented code representations. This pattern is commonly implemented by ORM Frameworks. They simplify data access by allowing developers to interact with the database using object-oriented programming concepts, eliminating the need to write raw *SQL* queries. An ORM Framework handles the mapping, querying, and persistence of objects to the database. The ORM frameworks that implement this pattern is most commonly seen as just a *tool* more than a pattern. ORM frameworks also provide features like caching, lazy loading, and change tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some of the most utilized ORMs are: **Entity Framework (C#)**, **Hibernate (Java)**, **TypeORM (JavaScript/Node)**, **SQLAlchemy (Python)**, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transfer Object (DTO)\n",
    "DTOs are objects used to transfer data between layers or components of an application. They are often used to encapsulate and transport subsets of data from one layer to another, improving performance and reducing network overhead. DTOs typically represent a flattened and simplified view of the data, tailored for specific use cases. It involves data transformation (parsing). It is common to use DTOs in the communication between the client and the server and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caching Pattern\n",
    "Caching patterns involve storing frequently accessed or expensive-to-compute data in memory to improve performance and reduce database load. Common caching mechanisms include in-memory caches, such as **Redis** or **Memcached**, which store data in a key-value format. Caching patterns can help reduce response times and improve scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Sourcing\n",
    "Event sourcing captures and persists every change or event that occurs in the system as a series of immutable events. Instead of storing the current state of an entity, event sourcing maintains a history of events, allowing the system to rebuild the current state by replaying the events. This pattern provides an audit trail, enables scalability, and supports complex business workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharding\n",
    "Sharding is a pattern used for horizontally partitioning large datasets across multiple database instances or shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and by distributing the data, sharding enables better performance, scalability, and parallel processing. However, sharding introduces complexity in data querying and managing data across multiple shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Transformation\n",
    "This pattern focuses on transforming data from one format or structure to another. It involves *mapping*, *parsing*, and *manipulating* data to ensure compatibility and consistency between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Replication\n",
    "Data replication patterns involve duplicating data across multiple systems or databases to achieve data synchronization, redundancy, and fault tolerance. It ensures that data is consistently available across distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Warehouse and Data Mart\n",
    "Data warehousing patterns involve the design and implementation of a central repository that consolidates and integrates data from various sources. Data marts, on the other hand, are smaller subsets of the data warehouse, focused on specific business areas or departments. These patterns facilitate business intelligence, reporting, and analytics by providing a structured and optimized environment for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These are some of the most common data management patterns, but there are many others like: Data Pipeline Pattern, Master-Data Management (MDM), etc... that we will not cover here."
