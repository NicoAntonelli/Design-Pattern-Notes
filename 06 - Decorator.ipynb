    "# Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically at runtime. It provides an alternative to subclassing for extending the functionality of an object by wrapping it with one or more decorator objects. The Decorator pattern enhances the flexibility and modularity of the code by allowing the addition of new behaviors without modifying the original object's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The Decorator pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Responsibility Principle: The Decorator pattern allows responsibilities to be divided among multiple classes, each with a specific role. The original object focuses on its core functionality, while decorators handle additional concerns. This promotes the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the codebase more maintainable and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open-Closed Principle: The Decorator pattern follows the Open-Closed Principle, allowing the extension of behavior without modifying existing code. New decorators can be added to introduce new functionalities without changing the original component or other decorators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility and Composability: Decorators can be combined and stacked to add multiple behaviors to an object. The flexible composition of decorators provides a wide range of possible combinations and allows for dynamic behavior modification at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Both components and decorators can be reused in different combinations. Components can remain unaffected by the existence of decorators, and decorators can be used with different components, promoting code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of Concerns: The Decorator pattern separates the concerns of the original object and its decorators. Each decorator focuses on a specific aspect of the behavior, keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transparent Functionality Extension: Decorators enhance the functionality of the original object transparently to the client code. The client code interacts with the object through its common interface, unaware of the presence of decorators. This makes it easy to add or remove decorators without impacting the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Decorator pattern is commonly used in scenarios where you want to add behavior to an object dynamically, such as adding functionalities to graphical components, applying filters to streams, or extending the behavior of user interfaces. It provides a flexible and modular approach to enhancing an object's behavior while adhering to the principles of object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- The Component interface or abstract base class defines the common interface for both the original object and its decorators. It declares the operations that can be performed on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ConcreteComponent class is the original object or component that provides the basic functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Decorator class is an abstract class or interface that also conforms to the Component interface. It holds a reference to a Component object and provides a base implementation for the operations. The Decorator class can be extended by concrete decorator classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ConcreteDecorator classes extend the Decorator class and add specific behaviors or functionalities. They enhance the behavior of the wrapped component by adding additional operations or modifying the existing ones."
