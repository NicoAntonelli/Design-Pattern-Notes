    "# Observer\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. It defines a mechanism where multiple observers (also known as subscribers or listeners) are notified and updated automatically when the state of a subject (also known as publisher or observable) changes. The Observer pattern allows loose coupling between objects, ensuring that changes in one object can be propagated to other objects without them being tightly coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The Observer pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loose Coupling: The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling between objects. The subject and observers are independent of each other and only communicate through the defined interfaces. This allows for better maintainability and flexibility in the system's design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensibility: It is easy to add new observers without modifying the subject or other observers. You can introduce new functionality by creating new observer classes and subscribing them to the subject. This makes the system more extensible and allows for future enhancements without impacting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-driven Architecture: The Observer pattern fits well into event-driven architectures. The subject can be viewed as a publisher of events, and the observers as subscribers listening for those events. When an event occurs, the subject notifies all the subscribed observers, allowing them to react accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reusability: Observers can be reused in different contexts or with different subjects. They are decoupled from the subject and can be easily plugged into other parts of the system that require similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistency: The Observer pattern helps maintain consistency between related objects. When the state of the subject changes, all the observers are notified and updated automatically. This ensures that all dependent objects remain synchronized with the subject's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced Dependencies: Using the Observer pattern reduces dependencies between the subject and observers. The subject does not need to have any prior knowledge of the concrete observer classes, as it only communicates with them through the observer interface. This enhances the modularity and testability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Observer pattern is commonly used in many scenarios, including user interfaces, event handling, message passing systems, and distributed systems. It enables a decoupled and flexible communication mechanism between objects, allowing for dynamic updates and easy extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- The `Subject` interface or abstract class defines the methods for attaching, detaching, and notifying observers. It also maintains a list of subscribed observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ConcreteSubject` class is the implementation of the Subject interface. It holds the state that can change and notifies its observers when the state is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Observer` interface or abstract class declares the update method that the observers must implement. This method is called by the subject to notify the observer about the state change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ConcreteObserver` class implements the Observer interface and defines the specific actions that should be taken when notified by the subject."
