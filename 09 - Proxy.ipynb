    "# Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It allows you to control access to the real object and add additional functionality without changing the existing code. The Proxy pattern can be used to add a level of indirection between the client and the real object, providing a way to manage object creation, access permissions, resource usage, and other aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- The Proxy pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remote Object Access: The Proxy pattern allows you to create a local representative for a remote object. The Proxy handles the communication with the remote object, making it transparent for the client. This can be useful when dealing with distributed systems or remote services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Controlled Access: The Proxy pattern enables you to control access to the real object. The Proxy can implement additional checks, such as authentication, authorization, or rate limiting, before allowing the client to invoke methods on the real object. This helps in enforcing security and access control policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deferred Object Creation: The Proxy pattern allows you to defer the creation of the real object until it is actually needed. This can be useful when the creation of the real object is expensive or requires significant resources. The Proxy can create the real object on-demand, improving performance and resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caching and Optimization: The Proxy pattern can be used to implement caching mechanisms. The Proxy can intercept requests and check if the result is already cached. If so, it can return the cached result directly, avoiding unnecessary computations or expensive operations. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the real object.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplified Client Code: The Proxy pattern abstracts away the complexities of accessing the real object. The client interacts with the Proxy using the same interface as the RealSubject, which provides a simplified and consistent interface for the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of Concerns: The Proxy pattern helps in separating the cross-cutting concerns from the core business logic. The Proxy can handle tasks like logging, auditing, or monitoring without modifying the RealSubject. This promotes code modularity and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Proxy pattern is commonly used in scenarios where you need to control access to an object or provide additional functionality without modifying the existing code. It helps in managing resources efficiently, simplifying client code, and adding cross-cutting concerns to the object interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- Subject: It defines the interface or abstract class that both the RealSubject and Proxy classes implement. This interface declares the methods that the client can invoke on the RealSubject.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RealSubject: It represents the real object that the Proxy stands in for. It provides the actual implementation of the operations defined in the Subject interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proxy: It acts as a surrogate for the RealSubject and controls access to it. The Proxy implements the same interface as the RealSubject and maintains a reference to it. The Proxy intercepts client requests and may perform additional tasks before or after delegating the request to the RealSubject.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client: It interacts with the Proxy object to perform operations on the RealSubject. The client is unaware of whether it is using the Proxy or the RealSubject since they both implement the same interface."
