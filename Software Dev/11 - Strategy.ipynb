    "# Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as a separate class, and make them interchangeable at runtime. It allows you to select a specific algorithm or strategy from a set of available options and use it without the client code having to know the specific implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The Strategy pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility and Extensibility: The Strategy pattern allows you to easily add or modify strategies without impacting the client code. New strategies can be added by creating new concrete strategy classes that adhere to the strategy interface. This makes the system more flexible and extensible, as it's easier to accommodate new requirements or variations of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: The Strategy pattern promotes code reuse by encapsulating the algorithm or strategy into separate classes. Different parts of the system can use the same strategy independently, promoting modular and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of Concerns: The Strategy pattern separates the algorithm or strategy from the client code. It allows the client code to focus on its primary responsibilities while delegating the algorithmic decisions to the strategy objects. This enhances code organization and maintainability by separating different concerns into distinct classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Testability: Since the strategies are encapsulated into separate classes, they can be tested independently. This makes it easier to create unit tests for each strategy, ensuring that they work correctly in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Runtime Configuration and Variation: The Strategy pattern allows for dynamic selection and configuration of strategies at runtime. The client code can switch between different strategies based on user input, system configuration, or other factors. This runtime flexibility enables dynamic behavior and customization of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation and Information Hiding: The Strategy pattern encapsulates the algorithm or strategy within its respective class. It hides the implementation details of the strategy from the client code, providing a clear separation of concerns and maintaining information hiding principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Strategy pattern is commonly used in various domains, including algorithms, business rules, optimization problems, and any situation where multiple interchangeable strategies or algorithms are required. It provides a clean and flexible way to manage variations in behavior, promotes code reuse and maintainability, and allows for dynamic customization and configuration of the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- The `Context` class represents the client code that uses the strategies. It maintains a reference to a `Strategy` object and can switch between different strategies at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Strategy` interface or abstract class declares a common method or set of methods that represent the algorithm or strategy. Each concrete strategy class implements this interface and provides its own implementation of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `ConcreteStrategy` classes represent the different algorithm implementations. Each concrete strategy class implements the strategy interface and provides a specific implementation of the algorithm."
