    "# Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. It provides a step-by-step approach to construct objects, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. The Builder pattern promotes a flexible and fluent way of creating objects, especially when the construction logic is complex or requires multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "The Builder pattern provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: The construction logic is encapsulated within the builder class, separate from the product itself. This ensures that the product creation process remains independent and simplifies the management of complex construction logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flexibility: The Builder pattern allows you to create different representations of the product by varying the configuration of the builder. You can modify or extend the builder class to accommodate different variations or configurations of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Readability: By using a fluent interface, the Builder pattern enhances the readability and maintainability of the code. Method chaining allows for a clear and concise way of configuring the product attributes, improving code comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separation of Concerns: The Builder pattern separates the construction of the product from its internal representation. This separation allows the product to remain immutable or ensures that its internal consistency is maintained during the construction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: The Builder pattern enables the reuse of construction logic across different products. If multiple products have similar construction steps, the builder class can be reused or extended to accommodate those products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testability: The Builder pattern facilitates the creation of testable code. The builder class can be easily mocked or substituted during testing to isolate the code under test and verify the construction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Builder pattern is commonly used in scenarios where the construction of an object involves multiple steps, intricate configurations, or when the product has many optional parameters. It provides a flexible and extensible approach to object creation, allowing you to create complex objects while maintaining a clean and readable codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- Define a common interface or abstract base class for the product that you want to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a builder class that implements the step-by-step construction process for the product. The builder class contains methods to set different attributes or properties of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The builder class provides methods to configure the product's attributes and returns itself (or a modified copy of itself) after each method call. This enables a fluent interface, allowing method chaining to set multiple attributes in a readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the builder class provides a method to retrieve the fully constructed product."
